## Migration Guides

### Migrating to v1.0.0

This release represents the first stable version of morfx with comprehensive production readiness improvements. Users of pre-1.0 versions should:

1. **Update Go Version**: Ensure Go 1.23+ is installed
2. **Review Configuration**: Check for any configuration changes
3. **Update Dependencies**: Run `go mod tidy` to update dependencies
4. **Run Tests**: Verify existing transformations still work correctly
5. **Update CI/CD**: Integrate new quality gates and coverage requirements

### Database Migration

The database schema is automatically migrated on startup. For large databases:

```bash
# Backup existing database
cp .morfx/morfx.db .morfx/morfx.db.backup

# Run morfx to trigger migration
morfx --migrate-db

# Verify migration success
morfx --verify-db
```

### Configuration Migration

Update configuration files from older formats:

```bash
# Convert legacy configuration
morfx config convert --input old-config.json --output .morfx.yml
```
